## Background and Overview    
The Global Financial Crime & Compliance (GFCC) team at SCW is tasked with identifying patterns of illicit financial activity across 10,000 synthetic global transactions. This analysis focuses on high-risk transactions (Risk Score ‚â• 7), tax haven flows, and industries disproportionately linked to black money.  

**Goals**  
1. Identify geographic and sectoral hotspots for money laundering risks.  
2. Evaluate correlations between shell companies, transaction types, and risk scores.  
3. Support enforcement partners with actionable intelligence on emerging illicit corridors

## Data Structure Overview  
### Dataset Schema

This analysis identifies critical vulnerabilities in global financial flows, with **Brazil, South Africa, and Singapore** emerging as high-risk transaction hotspots. Key industries like **Finance** (avg. risk score: 6) and **Arms Trade** (avg. risk score: 6) disproportionately enable suspicious activities, while **20% of reported transactions** (avg. risk score: 6) highlight systemic underreporting. Tax havens like **Panama** ($4.35B total flow) and **Luxembourg** ($4.34B) dominate illicit movements, with **January 2013** showing alarming spikes in high-risk activity.
